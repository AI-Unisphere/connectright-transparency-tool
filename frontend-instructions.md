# Frontend Instructions for the Procurement Portal

This document provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the frontend for the **Procurement Portal** feature, using the provided API documentation and initial templates generated by Loveable. Please follow these steps carefully.

---

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have access to the organizationâ€™s **frontend repository**.
2. Obtain the following files:
   - `documentation.md`: Full backend API documentation up to the procurement portal stage.
   - `frontend-instructions.md`: This file containing implementation instructions.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Download the Required Files
- Download the following files:
  1. `documentation.md` (API documentation).
  2. `frontend-instructions.md` (this file).
- Ensure these files are accessible locally on your machine.

---

### Step 2: Clone the Frontend Repository
- Clone the frontend repository from the organization. Use the following command in your terminal:
  ```bash
  git clone <frontend-repo-url>
  ```
- Navigate into the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd <frontend-repo-folder>
  ```

---

### Step 3: Place the Documentation in the Repository
- Move the downloaded `documentation.md` and `frontend-instructions.md` files into the root directory of the cloned frontend repository.

---

### Step 4: Prepare CursorComposer for Implementation
1. **Test The Frontend**:
   - First, test the frontend to see what it currently looks like and if it works, you can can use cursor composer to see how to deploy it locally in your machine.
2. **Provide General Context**:
   - First, provide a general context of the application, so that CursorComposer can understand the scope of the application in full and what we plan to build.
3. **Provide Context**:
   - Open CursorComposer and upload the following files or put in the prompt context:
     1. `documentation.md`
   - Use this document to explain the scope of the application to CursorComposer. Include the following points:
     - `documentation.md` contains details about backend API endpoints, responses, inputs, and user journey specifications.
     - Initial frontend templates were generated using Loveable, which provide a design structure.

2. **Set Expectations**:
   - Instruct Cursor Composer to:
     - **Analyze the API documentation** in `documentation.md` and identify relevant endpoints for current stage of the backend.
     - **Review the existing templates** in the frontend repository to understand the design flow and arrangement.
     - **Implement the API endpoints** in the appropriate frontend components/pages while maintaining the design flow and arrangement consistent with the existing templates or create new ones by adapting the existing templates.

---

### Step 5: Start Implementing with Cursor
- Begin the implementation process by:
  1. Introducing Cursor to the API documentation (`documentation.md`).
  2. Explaining the tasks:
     - Use the API endpoints provided to implement procurement portal features.
     - Maintain the design flow and aesthetics defined in the existing templates.

---

### Expected Output
- Fully functional frontend pages that integrate the **procurement portal** features.
- Design consistency with the templates generated by Loveable.
- Proper handling of API interactions, including requests and responses, as outlined in `documentation.md`.

## Notes
- If there are any ambiguities or gaps in the documentation, consult with me.
- Ensure all implemented features are tested for usability and responsiveness before final submission.
